## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes security in Distributed Information Systems (DIS) and implements a custom RSA-based end-to-end encryption algorithm for data protection. The study covers core security principles like **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**, identifies threats such as Man-in-the-Middle and DDoS attacks, and demonstrates how cryptography can secure communication between nodes in distributed architectures.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 3  
- RSA Cryptography   

## 🚀 Features  
- Simulation of a **distributed system** with multiple nodes.  
- Implementation of **end-to-end encryption** using RSA.  
- Message routing via a **proxy** to simulate blind routing.  
- Demonstrates the importance of **public/private keys** and cryptography in secure communication.  

## 📖 Key Insights  
- Each node generates its **public and private keys**, which are essential for secure communication.  
- The **proxy** routes encrypted messages without access to the content, maintaining confidentiality.  
- End-to-end encryption ensures sensitive data cannot be accessed by intermediaries.  
- Understanding RSA and key management is crucial for implementing secure distributed systems.
